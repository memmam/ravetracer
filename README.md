# Rave Tracer
A path tracer written in Rust and a variety of GPU APIs

## This is currently a placeholder repository.
Project has not started development yet pending posting of UCSD FA24 grades.

## What is this?
Rave Tracer is a reimplementation of the path tracer from the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series, with plans to also incorporate reimplementations in a variety of GPU graphics and compute APIs. Specific APIs being implemented are currently undecided pending exploratory work on what is possible in Rust. Additional features beyond those described in the books will likely be added once the initial implementation is finished.
